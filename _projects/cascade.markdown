description: Workflows for training adaptive surrogates for simulation
---

Machine-learned surrogate models can speed up scientific simulations by orders of magnitude, 
but present inherent cost-accuracy tradeoffs. One such tradeoff involves the risk of 
a simulation encountering a state for which the surrogate model is highly innacruate, i.e. a state 
that is far from the training data, leading to unrelaiable simulation results. We propose methods for 
updating surrogates on-the-fly in a distributed setting.
