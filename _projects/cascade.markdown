description: "Cascade is a continual-learning tool for scientific simulations. 
It uses distributed agents to run scientific simulations with ML surrogates, detect when these surrogates are likely to be unreliable, 
generate new training data, fine-tune models, and retry simulations run under models flagged as unreliable"

Machine learning (ML) surrogates can accelerate scientific simulations by orders of magnitude by replacing expensive numerical subroutines with comparably cost-effective ML model evaluations, but concerns about their reliability remain active among scientists.
Of particular concern is the possibility that a simulation will enter a state outside of the ML surrogate's training domain, leading to innacruate predictions.
On-the-fly learning, wherein ML surrogates are continually monitored for accuracy and updated when inaccuracy is suspected, increases the reliability of ML-driven simulations
Recent work from our group, Proxima, uses control-theory to ensure that simulation error meets a user-defined bound.
Cascade extends Proxima to a distributed setting to take full advantage of HPC resources. \
