I"<p>The changing landscape of science has created a world in which
significant amounts of scientific data is now distributed across a 
large number of disparate and heterogeneous storage
locations. It is not uncommon for data to be generated, analyzed, 
shared, published, and archived in different locations, 
each of which might even expose a different storage interface (e.g., 
Posix, object stores, etc.). Globus alone provides access to more 
than 10,000 active endpoints. There are also many thousands of 
scientific data repositories. This rapidly growing pool of 
storage systems has made the task of finding and managing
scientific data increasingly burdensome.</p>

<p>We are researching methods to index the world’s
scientific data irrespective of the location and model
in which it is stored. We aim to provide for the community
a scalable search index that allows researchers to find, browse,
and discover disparate scientific data based upon metadata buried
within scientific data formats. To achieve this goal we are
developing models for automatically extracting metadata from
within different formations, developing techniques to 
index this metadata both securely and flexibly using 
typed metadata, and designing approaches for keeping 
our index in sync with frequently changing data.</p>
