I"·<p>Yuliana Zamora presented a poster at   <a href="https://ceres.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html">CERES</a> titled â€œData Driven Analysis of GPU Benchmarkingâ€. The poster describes  a data-driven framework that makes use of data-analysis tools, such as machine learning and transfer learning, to reduce the time needed for engineers and researchers to predict the performance of a given software kernel on an arbitrary GPU architecture.</p>
